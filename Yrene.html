            <h2>Magical Abilities</h2>
            <p>Yrene possesses powerful healing magic, blessed by the goddess of healing, which she uses to help those
                in need. She helped heal Chaol's paralyzed legs so that he could walk again.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Connections</h2>
            <p>Yrene is married to Chaol Westfall and pregnant with their child. She is a healer of the Torre Cesme. She
                is now connected to the House Westfall and is in the Towers Family.
            </p>
            <p>Her father is from Eyllwe and is unnamed. Her mother is Josefin Towers. Her distant relatives are Rosana,
                Marte, Olgnia, and Yafa Towers. They were all healers who were also apart of the Torre Cesme.
            </p>
            <p>In the past, Aelin helped Yrene leave the tavern she was stuck working at so she could pursue her dream
                of being a healer and helping others. Aelin, who was Celaena at the time, left her jewels to buy passage
                on a ship and a note with "The world needs more healers" written on it.
